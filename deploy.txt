# Due to proxy cant seem to use maven to deploy
# So use appcfg
# appcfg uses what ever java is first on the path.
# For me this isn't a sdk (its a jre)
# this is because the user path variable (pointing to the sdk) is appended to the system path var which points to jre
# The first line fixes that 

mvn clean install
